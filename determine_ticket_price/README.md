# Algorithms: Ticket Price Determination and Clothing Advice

## Overview

This document explains two algorithms: one for determining the price of a ticket based on age and another for providing clothing advice based on temperature and weather conditions. Each algorithm uses simple conditional logic to produce useful outputs.

## Determine Ticket Price

### Description

The `determine_ticket_price` function calculates the price of a ticket based on the age of the individual. The pricing rules are as follows:

- Individuals aged 12 or younger pay $10.
- Individuals aged between 13 and 17 pay $15.
- Individuals aged 18 and older pay $20.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Read Age:**

   - Input the age of the individual.

2. **Determine Price Based on Age:**

   - If the age is `12` or younger, set the price to `$10`.
   - If the age is between `13` and `17`, set the price to `$15`.
   - If the age is `18` or older, set the price to `$20`.

3. **Output the Price:**
   - Display the calculated ticket price.

### Algorithm

```plaintext
FUNCTION determine_ticket_price
VAR
    age: INTEGER
    price: INTEGER
BEGIN
    Read(age)

    IF age <= 12 THEN
        price := 10
    ELSE IF age <= 17 THEN
        price := 15
    ELSE
        price := 20
    END_IF

    Write(price)
END
```

### Example

- **Input:** `age = 15`
- **Output:** `15`

- **Input:** `age = 25`
- **Output:** `20`

## Clothing Advice

### Description

The `clothing_advice` function provides clothing recommendations based on the current temperature and whether it is raining. The recommendations are divided into two scenarios: raining and not raining.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Read Temperature and Rain Status:**

   - Input the current temperature and whether it is raining.

2. **Determine Clothing Advice:**

   - **If it is raining:**
     - If the temperature is below `10°C`, advise wearing a warm coat and taking an umbrella.
     - If the temperature is between `10°C` and `20°C`, advise wearing a jacket and taking an umbrella.
     - If the temperature is `20°C` or above, advise wearing light clothing and taking an umbrella.
   - **If it is not raining:**
     - If the temperature is below `10°C`, advise wearing a warm coat.
     - If the temperature is between `10°C` and `20°C`, advise wearing a jacket.
     - If the temperature is `20°C` or above, advise wearing light clothing.

3. **Output the Clothing Advice:**
   - Display the recommended clothing based on the weather conditions.

### Algorithm

```plaintext
ALGORITHM clothing_advice
VAR
    temperature: INTEGER
    is_raining: BOOLEAN
BEGIN
    Read(temperature)

    Read(is_raining)

    IF is_raining = TRUE THEN
        IF temperature < 10 THEN
            Write("Wear a warm coat and take an umbrella.")
        ELSE IF temperature < 20 THEN
            Write("Wear a jacket and take an umbrella.")
        ELSE
            Write("Wear light clothing and take an umbrella.")
        END_IF
    ELSE
        IF temperature < 10 THEN
            Write("Wear a warm coat.")
        ELSE IF temperature < 20 THEN
            Write("Wear a jacket.")
        ELSE
            Write("Wear light clothing.")
        END_IF
    END_IF
END
```

### Example

- **Input:** `temperature = 5`, `is_raining = TRUE`
- **Output:** `Wear a warm coat and take an umbrella.`

- **Input:** `temperature = 15`, `is_raining = FALSE`
- **Output:** `Wear a jacket.`

## Usage

### Determine Ticket Price

1. **Call the Function:** Pass the age of the individual to compute the ticket price.
2. **Handle Age Ranges:** Ensure the function correctly handles age-based pricing.

### Clothing Advice

1. **Call the Function:** Pass the current temperature and rain status to receive clothing advice.
2. **Provide Conditions:** Ensure accurate input for temperature and rain status for appropriate recommendations.
